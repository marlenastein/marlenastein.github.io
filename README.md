This data shows the data of student enrollment at Lehigh categorized by state. The data is organized by four regions - Pennsylvania, New York/New Jersey, Other States and International. The data shows that over 90% of students are from the United States, and 60% are from either Pennsylvania, New York or New Jersey. From these results, we can see that a majority of Lehigh Students are local to the Bethlehem area. (https://data.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2022.pdf)
